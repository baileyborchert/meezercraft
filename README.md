# meezercraft

This is a static "business card" website to provide users, particularly potential players, with information about MeezerCraft, a now-closed Minecraft server that I used to own and administrate.

The mobile-first Bootstrap framework is used to optimize the site for all devices. The site features graphics made by me and custom CSS, including some simple hover animations, to make the site feel a bit more dynamic. The overall site is intended to have a cutesy look and feel to match our server's branding and catch the attention of our target audience.
